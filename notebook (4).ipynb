contact Debbie at Ext. 222","Last spring we called you to report that our sump pump that in the past 50 years has been used to eject laundry water from the basement, was running continuously since February.  You came twice to check on it including taking a water sample and 'listening' at the street shut off valve.  You did not detect a leak.   Since then we have had three plumbers in to look at the problem.  We scoped the sewer line, one listened at the interior shut off, and we turned off the building water to see if it affected the pumping.  All negative.  The sump pump continues to run every 90 seconds 24/7, and we have one flood when the pump was accidentally turned off.  This current drought has not affected it either.   We are not sure what you can do but  we know that we have a constant source of water entering the sump, which one of the plumbers said would probably rule out a sewer line leak.  We are a 20 unit condo building.  This water is coming from somewhere, but our water bill suggests it is not an internal leak, as well as the other tests.  We thought you should know.","This isn't about a fallen tree or tree limb but I didn't know how else to categorize it this.  The sidewalk on the north side of Lincoln Street, east and the North Shore Sanitary Canal and west of Chandler Newberger is becoming difficult to use because of the overgrowth bushes and weeds on the edge of the Canal Shores golf course.  The vegetation and branches are growing out over the sidewalk.  Please have a crew (from the City or the golf course) trim there to make the sidewalk more useable, especially now that kids are back in school, walking on this sidewalk to/from Orrington and Haven.  Thanks!","Actually on back side of 621 Howard, growth in rain gutter","This is not public property but I need help.   There's a raccoon in my back yard that I'm pretty sure has distemper.  It was staggering around and when I went out with a flashlight to see what was going on, it went under bushes on right side of my garage and I need help.   I cannot afford to hire a commercial wild animal removal service.   They charge over $100 and I simply don't have it.   If that raccoon has distemper, which I'm sure it has ( or maybe it has rabies -both distemper and rabies make animals stagger), it's a public health concern.   I live in a two flat and my upstairs neighbor has a child and I have cats, and there are lots of pets in this area.   Although pets should be vaccinated for distemper, not everyone does that, which means this sick raccoon could be a risk to people's pets, given that distemper is  an air borne disease.   I need help.   My phone number is 847-693-0038.   Again, I cannot afford to hire a service to remove it.   I called a few and they charge over $100 to remove a raccoon.  I don't have that and neither does my upstairs neighbor.   Please help me.  The raccoon is inside my back yard on the side of the garage where there are a lot of bushes, near the side door of the garage.   I will be home until 10am.   You can go into my back yard without my permission, please just get that poor, very sick raccoon.","Some type of flashing signal of exit fire truck. proper background color of signage (white, not yellow) for not blocking fire exit drive. Police can not enforce due to wrong background color. Flashing signal needed for safety reasons, numerous close calls with on coming traffic while exiting the station with emergency lights on. Repainting of street stripping to light post east of Reese (where signage currently is) possible a highlighting color (Red, red &white). please contact Capt. Taylor for questions or clarification at ext. 5945 would like to meet on 8/23 in AM to discuss some solutions or possible ideas.","All along dodge avenue from Howard through church landscaping crews have been blowing leaves into piles in the bicycle lane making it extremely unsafe. I have witnessed a bike rider slip and fall off her bike recently because of the amount of leaves in the lane. I am requesting that these landscaping crews be notified by a city official that piling leaves in the street is unacceptable and they must pack out their landscaping refuse not simply leave it in the road as I have seen them doing constantly.","NA","We have rat boxes from you guys out at the property already, but owners continue to see rats out at night in the parking lot.  Please let me know what we can do about this issue!","Mr. Chuck Haeger of 1318 Dewey is complaining of next door neighbor (Joseph) at 1320 Dewey. Mr. Haeger states there are rat burrows on neighbor's property, on the front lawn in front of the front porch. Mr. Haeger states he has approached his neighbor about the situation, but his neighbor doesn't seem to think this is a problem.  In the mean time, there are rats coming from his neighbor's property and running around the neighborhood.

First, a question, then the background: what is height for a wrought iron decorative fence in front yard? For over two years kids going east via Mulford from school have stolen the corner stakes I had securing small corner decorative fencing, which I'd replace.  I removed one of the corners last week after the stake was stolen again, and two days ago they stole another stake (to use as swords? Who knows?) Yesterday I removed the remaining corner fencing.  I think I saw the thieves, running and whooping over my front yard after school (yay!  We won! She took down the corner fencing!)  This has been very disturbing. If I replace with a full front garden-type decorative fence, how high can I go (I'd secure it w. cement so these little thieves can't pull it up).  Or, is there another solution to this constant thievery? Darlene Nilges (40 yr.

It is unfathomable to me that the use of excessive force was found to be justified. This innocent man was accused of stealing his car by a racist citizen who I'm sure meant to do good, but was mistaken. However, your officers could and should have worked to de-escalate and properly investigate the situation. Instead, you brutalized a brilliant and accomplished young man.   I do not feel safe in Evanston now that I know your officers react in this manner to situations that are not dangerous. I'm calling on you to fire the officers involved. I'm also calling on you to train your people (or re-train as the case may be) in nonviolent de-escalation methods of policing.   Evanston and Northwestern have such a rich relationship and history. Evanston itself is a beautiful and diverse community.  But the way your department treats people of color is unacceptable and is certainly making Northwestern a less safe place for students of color.  Please do not do this again.  Best, Tiernan","2 tires in the alley have been here for over a year","NA","Thursday, April 27, 2017  2 mattresses in the alley.

I request a formal hearing to discuss the 48 hour requirement for showings.  Poor policy and skewed: I believe the 48 hour showing notice is punitive to the property owners and  unnecessary. I understand that complaints of slum landlords entering  at will  was the etiology of this local policy to prevent such action and provide ample notice.  However, you are affecting the practice of licensed Realtors who have higher standard of care and a responsibility to show and sell properties.  You are basically taking away the hammer from  the carpenter when you don't permit timely showings which would be in a reasonable 24 hour notice.   Time is of the Essence: It places the property rights of Evanston property owners -clients in a harmful  position because you are losing potential prospects that cannot see the unit in the natural rhythm of the the 24 hour notice for showings that the Multiple Listing Service  is based on.    Anti-Competiton: You are directly blocking and preventing the sale and marketing of a property and it is Anti-competition and a potential Federal concern.    Practical: I encourage you to be more flexible with this issue.  As a Registered Nurse and Masters Social worker from the University of Chicago and 15 year Top Producer Real Estate Broker I feel I need to advocate for my clients. The 24 hour notice is the natural rhythm for a showing and places everyone on alert in the appropriate time and fashion.  I am confident that 90% of the Real Estate community would agree with me.  I have a particular situation at 1720 Maple unit 4th floor, Evanston, Illinois 60201 where the tenant has blocked my showings even with 48 hour notice.   If I can't show... I can't sell !

Visitors to the school almost always fill all spots in the vicinity and pretty much everyone in my building can never find parking within 3 blocks. Luckily last year we could purchase residential permits for Judson (just right across the street) and could sometimes find parking there in the 2hr parking. The problem is that this 2hr parking w/o permit is rarely enforced and those spots are taken by visitors as well.  So without having that option it makes things very difficult when dealing with an infant and having to carry groceries 3-4 blocks away in the cold weather. Last year we were told by the city that Lee Street was going to change to residential permit parking and that it would be zoned the same as Judson. That is why they sold us the permits last year. Is that still going to happen?

See the impages.  Apparently, underground electrical or cabling is being installed?  During this process, I have just spent an hour taking blacktop gunk out of my dogs paws, and my shoes are a mess.  The workers have shoddily dropped metal sheets to cover apparent holes (at least that's what one of them told me) on the sidewalks and on the street.   I thought perhaps maybe this was temporary, and when they were finished it would be resurfaced.  Does not appear that is happening.  If these are left as they are, when the snow and ice comes, it will be virtually impossible to walk on these sidewalks which are uneven at best now.  We have two people who use walkers in my building (738 Hinman) and can hardly get up the blacktop laden incline now.  I also attach a copy of a picture of the sidewalk right in front of our building -- which is treacherous.  An officer in the neighborhood I was chatting with some months back said, you should call the City, someone is really going to get hurt.  Are these sidewalks and streets going to be resurfaced when they are through?  Before the snow comes?  If not, how could you let this kind of shoddy work on the streets and sidewalks take place?  I'd love to get an update on what is going on, and when these issues will be fixed.","Resident is interested in insuring an elm street that is in the alley behind her home; the tree is just outside of her fence.

It didn't happen, or at least it looks like it didn't happen. Because street cleaning is now done so infrequently, it is hard for motorists to keep abreast of when it does, so cars are not moved to let the sweepers do a thorough job.   The very best way to ensure leaves are not littering this section of Forest (and parallel streets immediately to the west and east) would be to POST BILLS notifying residents of a FINAL street cleaning for the calendar year.    This is has been an annoying, ongoing problem for several years on this block, with a considerable amount of leaf debris littering both sides of Forest throughout the winter season.

The lights were turned off once he was through the intersection. One would think it was an emergency, but then he stopped at the next red light at Howard Street, so it was really just because he did not want to wait for the red light.  Aside from the fact that what he did was dangerous and illegal, it also adds to the perception that police are above the law and are able to abuse their power when it suits their convenience. Of course, a traffic infraction may be a small thing, but it was bothersome nonetheless.  I was not even going to report it at first, but it has bothered me since I saw it, and I believed it was important to bring this to your attention.

For your information, we live at 2233 Dodge Ave and our account # is 06622250-02.    I've always paid out bill without looking at the calculations since we moved in 2011, but recently I noticed the cost break-out of sanitation charges on the back of my bill.

These are the only two carts that we have at our house which is a single family home.    The total for these two carts should be $25.90 per month,  which would make our sanitation service charge $51.80 for a two month period.  However, the charge on our bill has alway been $71.80, which seems like it may be $20 too high.    Perhaps there are additional charges that I am not taking into account?

Since I live across the street and walk my dog by the park 4 times a day I look at the parkway/park all the time.  Yes, the grass is growing in nicely, but I do think it could use a lot more seed.  There are a lot of areas where the seed either blew away or washed away on both Simpson and Bennett parkways.  There is just dirt and if there is no more seed for the year it will again be a muddy mess in no time.  Would REALLY appreciate you reseeding the dirt area.

She has contacted Mayor Tisdahl and Wally about her dissatisfaction with the appearance of the wires and the possibility of hazardous conditions. She has contacted ComEd and ATT, but had no luck in getting the situation resolved.  I met with Dr. Zilla on 1/27/16 to discuss issues and take photographs (see network folder: P:\\Oscar\\2421 Brown Avenue - Wire Pics). I let her know that the issue would be relayed to our Public Works Director for review of potential hazardous conditions and to contact our staff liaisons at ComEd and ATT about dressing the wires properly now and for any future additions.  For more information, see resident's original email:  Hi Mayor Tisdahl, First of all, I want to thank you for facilitating the 7th ward meeting at the Civic Center last night. It was really helpful to hear from all the candidates who were there, and for the rest of us to have the opportunity to speak up about our visions and concerns as well. Thanks too for encouraging me to email you about my specific problem concerning the growing number of cable and electric wires that are ending up on the pole outside of the coach house I own, and that sits on an alley, away from the street. Background   Specifically, I own a small coach house on 2421 Brown Ave., and am part of a small condo association there. Long ago the maple tree on the alley next to my home of 17 years was cut down, replaced by a telephone/electric pole. Over the years, there weren’t that many wires. But within the last few years, not only Com Ed had wires, but more and more cable wires started going up.   The ‘growth’ of these wires has become seemingly exponential and really egregious in the last 18 months-2 years. What was once a few wires has now become somewhere around 24 total (and counting). This has made me very unhappy, in part because as a person nearing retirement, I know this will likely affect my property values. But even more so, I no longer enjoy just coming home after a long, hard day at work, unless I don’t look up at what I call an ugly mess, one that is with me 24/7. (Please see picture below, after wires were 'cleaned up'.) Others agree, including some of those below.  Attempted solutions I’ve talked to and tried to find solutions with the following: my condo association (4-5 wires come from our main building) City of Evanston: 311, plus searching the 311 city website (and tried Ald. Grover - she never responded) Comm. Ed.: their regular and regional rep (‘if you have $100,000. you can bury them’ - but did get some of the wires 'cleaned up') Cable: Comcast (many calls and multiple people, and visit by my regular cable guy - 'nothing you can do') ATT (many calls, multiple people)   Of all the companies and individuals I contacted above, I have to say probably the most disappointing was Jane Glover’s non-response. Fairly recently, I tried her home number, listed on the city website, a couple of times and left messages – but to no avail; she never called back.   Currently, in addition to wires coming from my condo association's main building (and we’re continuing to explore ‘bundling’ our cable providers), AT&T and Comcast wires are also coming from the house across the alley (I spoke to them, they seemed amenable), at least two other houses down the block (through back yards), and my next door neighbor (I spoke with her, she also seemed amenable). A second pole on the alley and Brown Ave., on the other side of my home, also has ‘fatter’ bundled wires, but is less unsightly. Thanks very much for listening, and for any help you can give.

I have serious concerns about the elimination of the 208 bus service along Church Street.  I have two daughters.  One is currently a Sophomore at Evanston Township High School (ETHS) and the other will be a Freshman at ETHS in the Fall.  The closest 208 Church Street bus stop is at Church & Samoset.  Currently it only takes 15 minutes to get to ETHS on the 208.  With the elimination of a bus route along Church Street, the only bus alternative is the 250 Dempster Street bus.  There is so much traffic in the morning along Dempster that it could take 45 minutes for the same 15-minute ride on the 208 Church Street  bus.  School District 202 does not have a transit system – it relies on public transportation - CTA and Pace.  We want to encourage and help teens get to school on time, not make things difficult.     Another concern about bus service along Dempster Street is the planned addition of PULSE bus service.  With only limited stops, the high schoolers will have farther to walk to a bus stop.  And there is no information on how PULSE service will affect the local / regular bus service along Dempster Street.  “Pace is evaluating the frequencies at which the current Route 250 will continue to serve existing local stops along the corridor” – this statement is from your own published information.  Therefore, the 250 Dempster Street bus does not sound like a viable alternative to get to and from ETHS.  Riders living near Church Street can now take the 208 Church Street bus to Old Orchard or Downtown Evanston for work, shopping, and entertainment.  They can’t get to Old Orchard or Jewel for grocery shopping on the 250 Dempster Street bus.  Many riders along the 208 route are elderly and would not be able to physically get to Dempster or Golf for the proposed alternate buses.    Alienating entire populations from viable public transit service seems incredibly unfair and short-sighted.  PLEASE RECONSIDER ELIMINATING 208 BUS SERVICE ALONG CHURCH STREET.

Flashing lights are triggers for migraines, clusters, and photosensitive epileptic seizures. The city’s response was “These signs were installed to address continued concerns from pedestrians crossing Green Bay with approval from IDOT since Federal Funds were used for this project.  Because of the location and visibility issues, these signs were installed to alert drivers that make fast right turns to stop for pedestrians.  The traffic control signs are regulated by FHWA and they have approved the use of the LED flashing signs.”  Although the FHWA approved the use of LED flashing signs, that agency did not mandate it.  Although IDOT approved it, that agency did not mandate it.  This was a choice that the City of Evanston made.  We all have concerns for pedestrian safety. No one wants to see a pedestrian hit by a car yet there are other alternatives to signs with flashing lights which can impact the wellbeing of residents.  Federal funds do not limit safety signs to those with flashing lights. Kindly provide a response that explains why the City of Evanston has installed something that can actually be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of some of Evanston’s residents and if it is going to continue down this road.

The right lane turns into a right turn only lane, and many drivers wanting to continue south on Green Bay use the right lane to try to pass the cars that are following the rules and waiting in line in the the left lane that is continuing south.

I have noted that there are many, many streets and neighborhoods that have the parkway trees trimmed for health and guided growth.  We spend a lot of money on the trees on our property at 1318 Greenwood.  Yet the only trimming that has ever been done by the city is for freeing the electric wires from branches of trees on our property (a job not at all well done or in the best interest of the trees).  None of the parkway trees have ever...seriously, ever.....been trimmed.  We have had to trim branches on some trees in front so we and our guests do not poke our eyes out after parking in front of our home.  I am formally requesting that the parkway trees on the block between Asbury to Wesley on Greenwood is put on the calendar and slated for trimming this Spring.  It is truly irresponsible for Evanston to allow these trees to grow without any checks for health or without trimming to avoid branch failure and safety of residents and guests who are coming from their parked cars to the homes in the 1300 block of Greenwood.  I would appreciate a response from the Department of Forestry to indicate when the crew will be assigned to our block.  Once in 25 years seems like a fair request, particularly when I, as a home owner, am required to keep the trees on our property in safe condition.  With the amount of real estate taxes collected by the city on the homes in this block I am sure you can find some $$$$ to trim our parkway trees.

For years, because of the old way that the lanes on Ridge Ave. were configured, vehicles travelling northbound on Ridge and wanting to enter the parking lot at 1800 Ridge had to drive north past the building, past Emerson St., and then U-turn somewhere to come back south on Green Bay to Ridge to access the entrance at 1800 Ridge. This was extremely inconvenient and confusing to drivers.  Hoping that the new construction and reconfiguration of lanes on Ridge might correct this inconvenience, I discover that there is still no way to access the parking entrance at 1800 Ridge, from the northbound lanes. Drivers still need to go way past Emerson, turn around and come back south on Ridge to get in.  My question is: Why was this not corrected? It's a total inconvenience to workers and visitors at the 1740 and 1800 Ridge Ave. buildings!  What can the city do to correct this oversight and error?

I understand this building is supported by TIFS.  Accordingly, the tenants of this building are suppose to support businesses, and bring more businesses to Evanston to lower taxes (property) and thus rents will become more affordable.  First and foremost, people can shop wherever they want and no one can guarntee that more businesses will choose to be in Evanston,  Secondly, putting the extra tax on small businesses and individuals for the next 7 years is a burden that no one who is just surviving should have to deal with.  Thirdly, with the rents so high why is the city not having these new buildings put aside a small percentage for low-income individuals ( the elderly on fixed incomes, the disabled, etc, why should they be banished to Church and Emerson, don't these individuals deserve to live where they have for many years.  I am currently on disability an my roommate is a senior citizen who is in  wheelchair and suffers from dementia, he is familiar with the current area we reside, why should he be unable to find a decent apartment iin the area that has an elevator, beccause we can not afford a $1500 rent?  Is Evanston trying to rid the city of the poor?

I have reported this issue many times to both ChargePoint and 311, but it's unfortunately not being addressed appropriately. The connector on the left charger can only be removed with excessive force, and then still doesn't work - the charger just constantly turns on and off every other second. The connector from the right charger also cannot be removed unless excessive force is applied, and then doesn't work at all. There is a message about no outlet or something similar.  I find it frustrating that this, presumably expensive, structure was built, presumably with tax payer money, and at this point serves absolutely no purpose.  To be fair, I'm very happy that Evanston has as many EV chargers as it does, more than most suburbs in the area. It was one of the reasons I felt good about purchasing an EV vehicle.  But there should be a procedure in place to perform maintenance on these stations, although I personally think that these stations need to be replaced, at least the connection part of them.

On behalf of myself and the dozens of other tenants at Shore View Apartments, located at 510 Sheridan Road.  Our building has become infested with mice (and seems to have been for several months), and the building managers and owners have not responded in a satisfactory manner.   Tenants have found rodent droppings and mice in their apartments. We have found boxes of food chewed on in cabinets. There are droppings in several locations throughout the common areas of the building (laundry room, hallways, etc). The basement is constantly flooded, which I'm sure has created a breeding ground for these vermin.   Outside of a few glue traps place in the stairwells, the people in charge of this building have done nothing.   In this e-mail I've enclosed pictures of the droppings, a large dead rat that was found outside, the basement that has been consistently flooded for the entire time I've been here, and a mouse that was caught on a glue trap.  Also included, is a picture of a flyer that was posted in the building urging tenants to contact the city to complain about the rodents. The flyer was put up on Saturday, and when the building manager saw it today they were removed.   There are people who have lived in this building for 5, 10+ years, who are now looking to move because of this problem, and the lack of response from the people in charge of this building. I myself am expecting a newborn son any day now, and this problem has worried my entire family.   Please, help the people of Shore View Apartments.

To my surprise the restaurant next door has valet parking and the cars took up the entire area and left no room for the Partransit bus.  I was told by the valet attendant that the bus can park by the X crossing.  This is utterly crazy.

Secondly, the parking attendants can not allow cars to take up all the spaces leaving no room for the paratransit buses for the disabled.  Please request that the valet parking does not continue to block the parking area in which these buses need to load and unload wheelchair passengers.  Also, please inform the attendants that X crossings can not be blocked while the bus loads and unloads passengers.

We are a responsible electronics recycling and asset recovery company based out of the Chicago-land area. Computers and other electronics are becoming obsolete at a faster rate every day. Many organizations landfill their unused or non-working IT related equipment. The State of Illinois has passed a law banning all electronics from landfills which has taken effect on January 1st, 2012. Other states such as Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin have also passed a similar law banning electronics from landfills. Putting electronics equipment into a landfill causes many issues both short term and long term due to the equipment’s composure of hazardous materials. Electronic waste consists of many components such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and other toxic and hazardous components.  This is where eCycle Solutions comes into play. Our company provides a responsible, environmentally friendly, secure, and an easy way to dispose of your obsolete and unwanted IT related equipment.  The only cost we have to apply is to those that are recycling old tube T.V's ($25 each) and old computer monitors ($10 each) All other electronics are accepted at no charge. For hosting this event our company will wave our pickup fee of $150 for your organization and supply a Pallet with a container to store the recycled electronics. Thank you for taking the time to read this through, let us start helping the community together.

As an Evanston resident living at 2212 McDaniel Ave (SW corner of McDaniel and Noyes), and as the District 65 PTA Child Safety and Welfare Chair, I have spoken to numerous adjacent neighbors about the need for a 4-way stop at this busy intersection. Everyone I have spoken to is open to signing a petition to help support this effort. It is difficult for pedestrians to cross McDaniel,  as well as Noyes due to the absence of a 4-way stop sign. Numerous children walk to Lincolnwood Elementary, as well as to summer camps, and McDaniel is well-traveled by both vehicles and pedestrians, and the number of cars attempting to pass cars that think there's a stop sign for N-S traffic on McDaniel is dangerous. It is also very difficult for cars turning north on McDaniel from Noyes to see traffic coming at speed South on McDaniel.  I have three children under the age of 6, and there are numerous families with elementary school aged-children and younger within a four block radius who must cross at this intersection. My neighbor said she requested a stop sign from the City of Evanston a couple of years ago but was turned down because of the slight bend in the road on McDaniel just north of Noyes and the rationale that it does not give drivers enough time to see the stop sign were it to be installed. This issue could easily be mitigated by posting a  4-way stop ahead  sign for cars heading south on McDaniel, just before the bend in the road. The small measure of installing a four-way stop at this location would increase safety for both drivers and pedestrians.   Thank you for your consideration. Feel free to contact me at (847) 644-6612 or amkwon@gmail.com. I am happy to discuss   Amos Kwon District 65 PTA Child Safety and Welfare Chair","Crossing Guard reported the  Do Not Walk  signal is not working on the north side of this intersection.","NA","Information was left on Saturday, October 14th via voicemail.","NA","NA","NA","NA","The sidewalk bricks in front of 1707 Benson are caving in.","NA","Caller states her recycling has been missed for 2 weeks.","Caller states their garbage dumpster is overflowing and and their landlord has not been able to respond to their contact.","NA","Resident left a voicemail Saturday at 1245 stating that the street is flooded.","Caller reports there are fresh survey marks on the parkway area in front of this property.

I put traps in my car, but it avoided them, taking bait without triggering the traps, so it appears to be clever.  I'd appreciate if you could come inspect the area again and see if we can do more trapping/killing of rodents in this area.  I do have some concern about poison rat bait... I have no problem poisoning rats, but I wouldn't want the poison to work its way up the food chain and kill other predators such as foxes, cats, hawks, owls... all animals that help control rats.  So I hope it's also possible to use snap traps and other techniques to kill the rats without unintentionally killing beneficial predators.

This seems to happen about once every other month.","On behalf of all the tenants in my building, I would like to bring to the city's attention the mice infestation in and around the residential building at 716/718 Reba Place.  After speaking with other tenants, we have concluded that there are hundreds of mice running in and around the building.  This is due to years of building neglect, and the city of evanston's lack of over site regarding this matter.  Any time a tenant complains to the landlords, they get angry and claim that particular tenant is the only one complaining, which is a lie!  In the last month alone, I have trapped and killed at least 25 mice.  That is almost one mouse per day.   This is not the first time we have complained about these landlords.  The last time we filed a complaint to the city, the landlords finally decided to have an exterminator (the landlords friend) come through and put down some traps.  The landlord ONLY acts when the city puts pressure on them.  (But you all dont put that much pressure so they get away with a lot.)  This only happened one time and it did not address the problem at all.  The landlord chooses her friends so that they can exaggerate the work being done.  They do this so they can fabricate the paperwork so that they can submit them to the city of evanston.    They constantly break the law in this city and nothing is being done about it.  I am not sure why the city of evanston does not do more to make sure the landlords at 716/718 reba place are taking proper care of their property.  It is not just a building issue its a community issue.  How many complaints do we have to file?  How many children have to get sick?  All the city of evanston ever does is tell them to put down glue traps.  They put them down in that first week, and then the problem continue.  NOTHING EVER GETS DONE!    Why doesn't someone come out and inspect the property and give them advice and what they can do?  Then come back to make sure its being done?  The city of evanston constantly let them get away with not handling this issue because you all just give them slaps on the wrist.  The city of evanton should carry some of the blame for this.  If the city of evanston I will take my complaint to a higher authority.  Someone needs to make sure the city of evanston is not just telling the landlord to lay down traps.  THE PROBLEM IS BIGGER THAN THAT.  SOME SERIOUS WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS BUILDING TO ADDRESS THE MICE INFESTATION ISSUE!!!!!  STOP ALLOWING CHILDREN TO GET SICK WHILE YOU ALL SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING!     I ran into one of the neighbors at 720 reba and they said they see mice running from 716/718 to their yard all the time and it is frustrating.  It is a health issue.  There are many young children that live in this building that are at risk of getting sick.  One lady said that her son ate mice dropping because it was accidentally mixed in with his food.  That kid had to miss an entire week of school to recover.  The mother said mice run on her floors and counters in the kitchen bathrooms and closets.  Te city of evanston needs to step of and take responsibility for this.  The city of evanston needs to see to it that the landlords are finding a long term solution to the mice infestation.    If the city refuses, ill take my complaints higher.    Landlords are Beverly Dyer and James Dyer","NA","NA","NA","Is requesting the total amount paid in 2015.

I was on my bike, got slammed by a car, and the driver of the vehicle immediately sped off after hitting me). Fortunately, I was able to procure the license plate of the vehicle. Unfortunately, I was severely abused by staff in the emergency room at Presence Saint Francis Hospital right after the accident. I am willing to provide you with more details regarding the hospital abuse with my attorney, my cognitive therapist, my local clergy friends, my mother, and my primary care physician by my side.  Today is Thursday, March 17th and the Evanston Police Department has refused to acknowledge my code of silence in regards to this matter. I have filed an official complaint with Chief Richard Eddington and I have still not heard back from anyone at the police department. I have also sent over five messages to the CEO of Presence Saint Francis Hospital, and they too have refused to acknowledge my code of silence in regards to this matter. I am wiling to elaborate further in regards to my code of silence with my family (and my attorney) by my side.  Mayor Tisdahl, I am using my God given gift of free will to align with the Higher Song of Creation's wishes to utilize a sophisticated  cognitive-prosthetic  interface that I have developed with God's help over the last nine years of my life. The system is referred to as Ahimsatran version 9.33 and allows me to communicate clearly and directly with anyone via my computer terminal at home. Due to my disability (in regards to my saccule gland), I do not utilize phone, email, fax, or text-messaging. I am also unable to process information in books in an effective manner at this juncture. I wear dielectric noise-cancelling headphones most of the day and I do not communicate using my vocal cords. I have shared these divine truths with both the police department and the hospital, but they are unwilling to acknowledge God's Truth at this juncture. I am being completely ignored and kicked to the curb.  Mayor Tishdahl... I am on my hands and knees, begging you to please meet with me as soon as possible in regards to this matter?

After Henry Daniels said that condition was addressed, I posted photos showing that condition is not addressed and in fact, not changed. I am now posting it as a new issue since my comments to the previous one were not responded to. I commented:  I am sorry to say that the site condition was not resolved. I attach 2 photos taken a few days after 3/28/16, showing the condition behind my garage after a prolonged drizzle (about a day). What was done seems to be a slight lowering of the alley, which maintained the same bumps and dips, and then some rocks were dropped into our dip. Water fills the dip and sits atop the rocks. As I suggested, the alley needs to be lowered, by at least a foot, but possible much more, and also leveled out completely. The details should be determined by a professional. Running a truck with a big shovel a few times, just won't do it. Please address.   Since the last comment, the issue has recurred with each rain, small or large.
